SYSTEM RECOVERY (SR) - Windows

 
 
?     ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUPPORT

    Quick Tip:

        If an issue is specific to SMP (ex: install of SMP failing), DO NOT refer the customer to Symantec Support. 
        Troubleshoot the case as normal and engage help via SME/Support Forum as needed. 
        If normal troubleshooting does not help, Symantec Support can be engaged via a formal agreement between Veritas & Symantec Support. 
        For this to happen, the case needs to be advanced to backline.

















        Collect SymHelp logs from the affected machine(s) – for Windows clients only. 
        Collect logs for Linux clients:
            See: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.TECH160280. 
        Collect logs for Management Solution:
            See: https://support.symantec.com/en_US/article.HOWTO44354.html.
        If Universal Serial Buss (USB), Removable Disk Technology (RDX) or Network Attached Storage (NAS) are being used as backup destination; collect all relevant hardware details about these devices.

        Are the affected machines physical or virtual? (if virtual, confirm if Hyper-V or ESXi and check version).
        Is this a Storage Area Network (SAN)/Cluster environment?
            If yes, collect all relevant details of configuration.

                                                                                               (back to top)

 
     TROUBLESHOOTING COMMONLY KNOWN ISSUES

    A. INSTALLATION SUPPORT 

        For any SR Windows installation problem, refer to the following:
            Install log: \ProgramData\Symantec\Symantec System Recovery\Logs\SSRINST.HTM
            MSI log: \Users\user_name\AppData\Local\Temp\MSIxxxxx.LOG
                A verbose Microsoft Installer (MSI) log may be required, see: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/223300?wa=wsignin1.0.
                Refer to Windows Installer Error Messages, see: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa372835%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396.
        For any SR Linux installation problem, refer to /var/log/symsr/InstallUninstall.log and check Linux version using the following commands:
            Red Hat: cat /etc/redhat-release

     

        Confirm the customer has the correct license with the following: http://bubba2.htr.ven.veritas.com/bubba/bubba.php 

                                                                                               (back to top)
     
    B. BACKUP QUESTIONS AND SUPPORT

        What type of backup are you performing?
          1a. Recovery point set?
          1b. Independent?
          1c. File/folder level)?
        What error is seen?
            Check the following for details:
            \ProgramData\Symantec\Symantec System Recovery\Logs\Symantec System Recovery.log.txt and/or the Windows Application Event Log
        What volume(s) are included in the backup?
          3a. Is failure still seen if you backup each volume on it’s own?
            This step may confirm if the problem is specific to a certain volume.
        Is backup being run over the network?
            If yes, check to see if the following helps:
                See: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.TECH171456.
        What is being used as the backup destination?
            Collect hardware details of USB drive, RDX, NAS etc.
        If backup destination is USB/RDX, are the drives being used in a rotation system?
            If yes, collect details on how many drives are being used, how the backup is configured and when the drives are being disconnected/connected.
            For more details on USB rotation:
                See: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.000075463. 

        For any VSS errors/failures: 
            Collect the output of running the following command (VSSADMIN LIST WRITERS >c:\vss_writers.txt) to check which writer may be failing.
        For a VSS failure: 
            Check free space is enough for a snapshot. 
            Check the following for details, see: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.TECH205081. 
        If a certain volume is failing to backup:
            Check PartInfo.txt & SMEDump.txt files for signs of errors/problems.
                Found in the ‘Files’ folder of a SymHelp .sdbz file).
        For Linux backup failures: 
            Check if the file system is supported.
            Check the SCL for details.
            Run the MOUNT command in Linux to check which file systems are being used.

                                                                                               (back to top)
     
    C. RESTORE QUESTIONS AND SUPPORT

        What type of restore is being performed?
          1a. Full system restore?
          1b. File/folder level restore using Recovery Point Browser?
          1c. Exchange level restores using Granular Recovery Option (GRO)?

        If this is a Restore Anyware (restore to different hardware): 
            Collect hardware details of both the source and destination machines. 
            Confirm that the operating system being restored is supported on the destination machine (check hardware vendors website for details).
        For full system restore (using recovery disk):
            Check customer is following correct steps for restore
                See: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.TECH129112.
        If restore fails with a corruption error: 
            Open the recovery point file using the Recovery Point Browser, then run a manual verify.
            This step will confirm if the recovery point is corrupt or not.
        If a restore using the recovery disk is failing:
            Collect logs after the failure has been reproduced. 
                See: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.TECH54540. 
            These logs MUST be collected before the machine is restarted at the end of the restore.
        For Exchange restore issues with GRO:
            Check to see if the recovery points can be mounted outside of GRO.
                See: http://www.veritas.com/docs/000070668.
            If the mount fails, Exchange restore with GRO will not be possible. 
            Focus on fixing the mount issue first.
        If restoring to a different machine/disk:
            Check if the target disk is big enough. 
                Use the formula in the following TechNote (TN) to calculate this.
                    See: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.TECH126288.
        For Exchange restore with GRO: 
            Check that the version of Outlook being used is supported. 
            Check the Software Compatibility List (SCL).
        For a Linux restore (full system restore):
            Check if the customer is restoring to different hardware.
            This is not currently supported – refer customer to Linux User Guide.
                See: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.DOC7515.

                                                                                               (back to top)
     
    D. (SYSTEM) RECOVERY DISK (SDR) QUESTIONS AND SUPPORT

        Disks not seen by the recovery environment?
            Run DISKPART | LIST DISK command to confirm what disks are detected by WindowsPE. 
            If disk is not seen, run DISKPART | RESCAN command to see if this helps.
        Hardware (disks, network card etc) not detected by the recovery environment?
            First check the version of WindowsPE (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WinPE). 
            This version can then be ‘mapped’ to the relevant version of Windows.
                See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Preinstallation_Environment#Versions. 
            Once this is known, load the relevant driver using the Utilities | Load a Driver option. 
                The driver should be obtained from the hardware vendor.
        SRD slow to bootup?
            Check: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.TECH142471.
        What version of Windows was the System Recovery Disk (SRD) created on?
            Check: https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.TECH225890
          4a. What version of Windows are you attempting to restore?

        If this is a Restore AnyWare (restore to different hardware), 
            Confirm with the hardware vendor that the version of Windows being restored is supported with the hardware being used.
        If problem creating a recovery disk (SRD):
            Check the following log for errors:
            \ProgramData\Symantec\Symantec System Recovery\Logs\SRDCreatorUI.log
